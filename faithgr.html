                <p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style display-7">“As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem, he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria. As he entered a village there, ten lepers stood at a distance, crying out, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” He looked at them and said, “Go show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed of their leprosy.”Luke 17:11-14 NLT<br><br>HE told them to go and this was more about trusting and having faith for the healing.<br><br>At this time, lepers were known as outcasts to society where people saw them as unclean. They were normally put into isolation. This was a harsh life a person with leprosy lived!<br><br>HE told them to go and this was more about trusting and having faith for the healing.<br><br>Later, one of the men saw the miracle of Jesus healing him and had a response to run back and he was yelling "Praise the Lord!"<br><br>“Jesus asked, “Didn’t I heal ten men? Where are the other nine? Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?” And Jesus said to the man, “Stand up and go. Your faith has healed you.””Luke 17:17-19 NLT<br><br>Why didn't they come back? Maybe they didn't see the healing immediately and went another way. Maybe people started to define them cause of how they looked and the words that people used to define them became more important to them.<br><br>Our perspective becomes corrupted with what people say about us, then eventually we can't even see ourselves how Jesus sees us<br><br>Jesus saw past the disease and saw their potential and HE saw their hearts. He knew that they had purpose and value.<br><br>Jesus takes what the world may see as lost and what the world puts into isolation and He restores them and gives them purpose. God has a purpose for all of you and HE is calling all of you out into a new and exciting life with HIM. He has cleaned your vision so you can now see what HE sees.<br><br>You are loved<br><br>“This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!”2nd Corinthians 5:17 NLT<br><br>“For I know the plans I have for you,” says the LORD. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. In those days when you pray, I will listen. If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me.”Jeremiah 29:11-13 NLT<br><br></p>
